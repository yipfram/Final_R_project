# Final R project - BQFFSR
To run this project you have to:
    1. Run the Rscript.R code (About 1.3 or 2.7 minutes of run, depends on which .csv file choosed)
    2. Than you can run the index.html file :)

## Requirements
The list of R packages needed are the following:
  - *Dyplr*
  - *Tydiverse*
  - *httr*
  - *jsonlite*
  - *ggplot2*
  - *knitr*

Be sure to install them by using `install.packages(the_library)`

Also, for the .qmd file, make sure to install quarto, additionnal packages might have to be installed, they will be indicated by Rstudio
Make sure to install quarto 
`
install.packages("quarto")
`

> If the code does not find the .csv file, change the wd with setwd("/the_current_directory")

##### Enjoy ;)
